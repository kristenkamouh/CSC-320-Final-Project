# CSC320 MIPS Assembly Calculator Documentation

### By Kristen Kamouh & Olexandr Ghanem

## Overview:
MaxiCalc is a comprehensive calculator program designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations, as well as more advanced operations such as exponentiation, factorials, and modulo operations.

## Key Features:

### 1. Calculator Functions:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo.
- **Other Operations**: square, factorial, sum(m, n) and power.

### 2. Memory Functionality:
- **Memory Feature**: Develop a feature enabling users to store and recall values using memory registers. Operations such as storing the current result, recalling stored values, clearing memory, and performing arithmetic operations on memory values should be supported.

### 3. User Interface:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: 
  - Implemented a text-based interface with menus and prompts for input and output.
  - Ensured ease of navigation through calculator functions and memory/history features.

### 4. Error Handling:
- **Robust Error Handling**: 
  - Implemented input validation to handle:
    - Invalid inputs
    - Division by zero
    - Overflow/underflow conditions
    - Other potential errors gracefully.
