# CSC320 MIPS Assembly Calculator Documentation

### By Kristen Kamouh, Olexandr Ghanem and Rabih Housami

## Overview:
MaxiCalc is a comprehensive calculator program designed to perform a wide range of mathematical operations. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing arithmetic calculations, as well as more advanced operations such as exponentiation, factorials, and modulo operations.

## Key Features:

### 1. Calculator Functions:
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and modulo.
- **Other Operations**: square, factorial, sum(m, n) and power.

### 2. Memory Functionality:
- **Memory Feature**: Develop a feature enabling users to store and recall values using memory registers. Operations such as storing the current result, recalling stored values, clearing memory, and performing arithmetic operations on memory values should be supported.

### 3. User Interface:
- **User-Friendly Interface**: 
  - Implemented a text-based interface with menus and prompts for input and output.
  - Ensured ease of navigation through calculator functions and memory/history features.

### 4. Error Handling:
  - Division by zero
  - Overflow/underflow conditions
  - Other potential errors gracefully.


 
## How to Use

To utilize the MIPS calculator program, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Files**: Download the project files from the repository.

2. **Unzip the Files**: Extract the contents of the downloaded ZIP file to a directory of your choice.

3. **Assemble the MIPS Code**:
   - Locate the `mips3.asm` file in the extracted directory.
   - Assemble the MIPS in MARS.

4. **Execute the Program**: After assembling the code successfully, execute the resulting binary or load it into a MIPS simulator to run the calculator program.

5. **Interact with the Calculator**: Follow the on-screen prompts to input numbers and select the desired operation.

6. **Repeat or Exit**: After completing an operation, the program may prompt you to perform another calculation or exit. Follow the instructions accordingly.
